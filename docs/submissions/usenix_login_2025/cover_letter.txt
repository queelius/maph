Subject: Article Submission - "maph: Achieving Sub-Microsecond Key-Value Storage"

Dear ;login: Editors,

I am pleased to submit "maph: Achieving Sub-Microsecond Key-Value Storage" for consideration as a feature article in ;login: magazine.

This article presents a practical approach to building ultra-fast key-value stores that achieve sub-100 nanosecond latency—an order of magnitude faster than Redis. Rather than presenting purely academic research, the article focuses on engineering insights and practical techniques that practitioners can apply to their own systems.

The article is particularly relevant to the ;login: readership because:

1. **Practical Focus**: It demonstrates how to combine well-known techniques (memory mapping, perfect hashing, lock-free algorithms) in novel ways to achieve exceptional performance.

2. **Real-World Applications**: The techniques have immediate applications in high-frequency trading, machine learning inference, and real-time gaming—domains many USENIX members work in.

3. **Open Source**: Full source code is available on GitHub, allowing readers to experiment with and build upon the ideas presented.

4. **Accessible Writing**: The article explains complex concepts in straightforward language, making it accessible to practitioners who may not be systems researchers.

5. **Performance Results**: Concrete benchmarks demonstrate 10× improvement over Redis and near-linear scaling to 98 million ops/second, providing clear evidence of the approach's effectiveness.

The article is approximately 3,000 words and includes performance comparisons, code examples, and practical guidance on when to use these techniques. It has been written specifically for the ;login: audience, balancing technical depth with readability.

I am a PhD student at Southern Illinois University researching high-performance systems. This work emerged from practical needs in building low-latency data stores for financial and ML applications.

The article has not been published elsewhere and is not under consideration at other venues. I am happy to revise it based on reviewer feedback to best serve the ;login: readership.

Thank you for considering this submission. I look forward to your response.

Sincerely,
