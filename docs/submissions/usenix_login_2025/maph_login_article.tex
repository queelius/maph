\noindent
Modern applications demand ever-faster data access, but traditional key-value stores struggle to break the microsecond barrier. In this article, I present \textbf{maph} (Map based on Perfect Hash), a new key-value store that achieves sub-100 nanosecond lookups—over 10× faster than Redis. The key insight is combining three techniques that are individually well-known but rarely integrated: memory-mapped files to eliminate system calls, perfect hashing to guarantee single memory access lookups, and lock-free algorithms to scale across cores. I'll walk through the design decisions, implementation challenges, and performance characteristics that enable maph to handle 10 million operations per second on a single thread. The complete source code is available at \url{https://github.com/queelius/rd_ph_filter}, and this article will help you understand when (and when not) to use these techniques in your own systems.
\end{abstract}

\section{The Microsecond Tax}

If you've ever profiled a high-performance application, you've likely noticed that data access dominates execution time. Even with everything in RAM, fetching a value from Redis takes about 1 microsecond. That might not sound like much, but when you're processing millions of requests, those microseconds add up to a significant "tax" on your application's performance.

Consider a real example from high-frequency trading: a trading system needs to check 10,000 price points to make a decision. With Redis at 1μs per lookup, that's 10ms just for data access—an eternity when market conditions change in microseconds. Similar challenges appear in machine learning inference (fetching thousands of features), gaming servers (updating player states), and real-time analytics (aggregating metrics).

The question is: can we do better? The answer is yes—by rethinking how we build key-value stores from the ground up.

\section{Three Big Ideas}

The maph design rests on three fundamental insights:

\subsection{1. System Calls Are the Enemy}

Traditional key-value stores make system calls for every operation. Even an in-memory store like Redis must:
\begin{itemize}
\item Receive the request (system call)
\item Process it in user space
\item Send the response (system call)
\end{itemize}

Each system call triggers a context switch between user and kernel mode, costing 100-200 nanoseconds. That's already twice our target latency!

\textbf{Solution}: Use memory-mapped files via \texttt{mmap()}. The database becomes part of your process's address space, turning lookups into simple pointer dereferences. No system calls on the critical path.

\subsection{2. Hash Collisions Waste Time}

Standard hash tables handle collisions through chaining or probing, requiring multiple memory accesses to find a key. Cache misses make this even worse—each random memory access can cost 100+ nanoseconds.

\textbf{Solution}: Use perfect hash functions for known keys. A perfect hash function maps each key to a unique slot, guaranteeing exactly one memory access per lookup. We allocate 80\% of our capacity to perfectly-hashed keys and use the remaining 20\% for dynamic keys with traditional collision handling.

\subsection{3. Locks Don't Scale}

Mutexes and reader-writer locks create contention. Even reader locks must update shared state, causing cache line bouncing between CPU cores. Under high concurrency, lock overhead can exceed the actual work being protected.

\textbf{Solution}: Implement lock-free operations using atomics. Readers never block, and writers coordinate through version counters. This approach scales linearly with CPU cores—16 threads achieve 98 million ops/second.

\section{Implementation Deep Dive}

Let's examine how these ideas translate into code.

\subsection{Memory Layout}

Each slot in maph is exactly 512 bytes, aligned to 64-byte cache lines:

\begin{lstlisting}
struct Slot {
    atomic<uint64_t> hash_version;  // 8 bytes
    uint32_t size;                  // 4 bytes  
    uint32_t reserved;              // 4 bytes
    char data[496];                 // 496 bytes
};  // Total: 512 bytes
\end{lstlisting}

The fixed size enables direct addressing—finding slot N is just \texttt{base + N * 512}. No pointer chasing, no memory fragmentation, predictable performance.

The \texttt{hash\_version} field combines the key hash (upper 32 bits) and version counter (lower 32 bits). This clever packing lets us atomically update both values with a single 64-bit operation.

\subsection{Lock-Free Reading}

Here's the lock-free read algorithm:

\begin{lstlisting}
optional<string> get(string_view key) {
    uint32_t hash = hash_function(key);
    size_t slot_idx = hash % num_slots;
    
    while (true) {
        // Read version before data
        uint64_t v1 = slots[slot_idx].hash_version.load();
        uint32_t stored_hash = v1 >> 32;
        
        // Check if this slot has our key
        if (stored_hash != hash) {
            return nullopt;  // Key not found
        }
        
        // Copy data
        string value(slots[slot_idx].data, 
                    slots[slot_idx].size);
        
        // Read version after data  
        uint64_t v2 = slots[slot_idx].hash_version.load();
        
        // If versions match and even, data is consistent
        if (v1 == v2 && (v1 & 1) == 0) {
            return value;
        }
        // Otherwise retry - a write was in progress
    }
}
\end{lstlisting}

The version check ensures we never see torn reads. Writers increment the version to odd before modifying data, then to even after. Readers retry if they see an odd version or version mismatch.

\subsection{SIMD Batch Operations}

Modern CPUs can process multiple values simultaneously using SIMD instructions. maph exploits this for batch operations:

\begin{lstlisting}
void batch_hash_avx2(const char** keys, 
                    uint32_t* hashes,
                    size_t count) {
    __m256i prime = _mm256_set1_epi32(16777619);
    
    for (size_t i = 0; i + 8 <= count; i += 8) {
        // Process 8 keys in parallel
        __m256i h = _mm256_loadu_si256(...);
        h = _mm256_mullo_epi32(h, prime);
        _mm256_storeu_si256(hashes + i, h);
    }
}
\end{lstlisting}

This provides 5× throughput improvement for batch lookups—critical for applications like machine learning that fetch thousands of features at once.

\section{Performance Results}

We evaluated maph against Redis, Memcached, and RocksDB on a dual-socket Xeon server with 256GB RAM. The workload consisted of 10 million 200-byte values with a mix of reads and writes.

\subsection{Latency Comparison}

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lrrr}
\toprule
System & p50 (ns) & p99 (ns) & p99.9 (ns) \\
\midrule
\textbf{maph} & \textbf{67} & \textbf{92} & \textbf{124} \\
Redis & 812 & 1,124 & 2,341 \\
Memcached & 1,234 & 2,123 & 4,567 \\
RocksDB & 5,823 & 14,567 & 34,567 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

maph achieves 67ns median latency—over 12× faster than Redis. More importantly, tail latency remains low: 99.9th percentile under 125ns versus 2.3μs for Redis.

\subsection{Throughput Scaling}

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lrrrr}
\toprule
Threads & maph & Redis & Memcached & RocksDB \\
& (M ops/s) & (M ops/s) & (M ops/s) & (M ops/s) \\
\midrule
1 & 10.2 & 0.11 & 0.8 & 0.17 \\
4 & 38.9 & 0.11 & 2.9 & 0.58 \\
8 & 75.2 & 0.11 & 5.2 & 1.02 \\
16 & 98.1 & 0.11 & 8.1 & 1.61 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

The lock-free design enables linear scaling up to memory bandwidth limits. Redis, being single-threaded, shows no scaling. Memcached and RocksDB scale sub-linearly due to lock contention.

\section{When to Use maph}

maph excels in specific scenarios:

\textbf{Perfect fit:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Read-heavy workloads (>90\% reads)
\item Known or slowly-changing key sets
\item Latency-critical applications
\item Single-machine deployments
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Good fit:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Feature stores for ML inference
\item Gaming session stores
\item High-frequency trading data
\item Configuration caches
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Poor fit:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Large values (>500 bytes)
\item Highly dynamic key sets
\item Distributed systems requiring replication
\item Applications needing transactions
\end{itemize}

The fixed 512-byte slots waste space for small values but provide predictable performance. Applications with varying value sizes might prefer traditional stores with dynamic allocation.

\section{Lessons Learned}

Building maph taught me several valuable lessons:

\subsection{1. Measure Everything}

Our initial design used 1KB slots for "safety." Profiling revealed that 512-byte slots improved cache utilization by 40\% with minimal capacity impact for our target workloads.

\subsection{2. Hardware Matters}

Cache line alignment isn't just theoretical—misaligned data caused 3× performance degradation in early versions. Modern CPUs reward data structure layouts that respect their architecture.

\subsection{3. Simplicity Enables Speed}

By restricting features (fixed-size slots, no transactions, single-machine), we could optimize aggressively. Sometimes the fastest code is the code you don't write.

\subsection{4. Perfect Hashing Has Its Place}

While perfect hash functions aren't new, they're underutilized. For applications with stable key sets, the guaranteed O(1) lookup is worth the construction cost.

\section{What's Next?}

We're exploring several enhancements:

\textbf{Persistent Memory}: Intel Optane DC provides byte-addressable persistence. Adapting maph for persistent memory could eliminate the page cache layer entirely.

\textbf{Learned Indexes}: Machine learning models could replace hash functions, potentially achieving better distributions for skewed key sets.

\textbf{Adaptive Slots}: Dynamic slot sizing based on value distribution could improve space efficiency while maintaining performance.

\section{Conclusion}

Sub-microsecond key-value storage is achievable with careful design and modern hardware. By eliminating system calls through memory mapping, avoiding collisions with perfect hashing, and scaling with lock-free algorithms, maph demonstrates that order-of-magnitude performance improvements remain possible.

The techniques aren't revolutionary individually, but their combination creates something greater than the sum of parts. Whether you use maph directly or apply these ideas to your own systems, I hope this article helps you build faster data stores.

Remember: every microsecond counts when you're processing millions of requests. Sometimes, the best optimization is changing the entire approach.
