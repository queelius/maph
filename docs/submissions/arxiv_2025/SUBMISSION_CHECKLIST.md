## Verification Checklist

### Content Verification
- [ ] Paper is self-contained (no missing references)
- [ ] All tables and algorithms render correctly
- [ ] Code listings are properly formatted
- [ ] Bibliography is complete
- [ ] No proprietary or confidential information

### Format Verification

- [ ] Font size 11pt (readable)
- [ ] Single column format for technical report
- [ ] Page numbers included
- [ ] Margins at least 1 inch

### Technical Verification

- [ ] All citations resolve correctly
- [ ] Math notation renders properly
- [ ] Algorithms display correctly

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: Endorsement Required
**Solution**: Request endorsement from a colleague or advisor who has published in cs.DB. Include paper abstract in request.

### Issue: LaTeX Compilation Fails
**Solution**: 
1. Remove conference-specific packages
2. Use standard article class
3. Test locally with TeX Live 2020+ (arXiv's version)

### Issue: PDF Too Large
**Solution**:
1. Compress images if present
2. Use vector graphics instead of raster
3. Remove unnecessary packages

### Issue: Bibliography Errors
**Solution**:
1. Use \begin{thebibliography} instead of BibTeX (simpler for arXiv)
2. Ensure all citations are defined

## Notes

- arXiv submissions are permanent and cannot be removed
- Updates create new versions but old versions remain accessible
- Consider submitting after final proofreading as v1 is most cited
- Include GitHub link for reproducibility
- Technical reports don't require peer review, making arXiv ideal for rapid dissemination
