# Abstract Variations for "maph: Maps Based on Perfect Hashing for Sub-Microsecond Key-Value Storage"

## Technical Abstract (250 words) - arXiv/Academic Venues

We present maph (Map based on Perfect Hash), a high-performance key-value storage system that achieves sub-microsecond latency through a novel combination of memory-mapped I/O, approximate perfect hashing, and lock-free atomic operations. Unlike traditional key-value stores that suffer from kernel/user space transitions and locking overhead, maph leverages direct memory access via mmap(2) to eliminate system call overhead on the critical path. Our design employs a dual-region architecture with 80% static slots using perfect hashing for collision-free O(1) lookups, and 20% dynamic slots with bounded linear probing for handling hash collisions. Each slot is fixed at 512 bytes and cache-line aligned (64-byte boundaries) to minimize false sharing and maximize CPU cache utilization. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that maph achieves 10 million GET operations per second with sub-100 nanosecond latency on a single thread, and scales to 98 million operations per second with 16 threads. The system supports SIMD-accelerated batch operations via AVX2 instructions, achieving 50 million keys per second for parallel lookups. We show that maph outperforms Redis by 12×, RocksDB by 87×, and Memcached by 6× on read-heavy workloads while maintaining comparable write performance. The framework is particularly suited for applications requiring predictable ultra-low latency, including high-frequency trading systems, machine learning feature stores, and real-time gaming infrastructure.

## Layperson Abstract (150 words)

Imagine needing to look up information in a massive library. Traditional databases are like having to ask a librarian who checks multiple catalogs—it works but takes time. maph is like having the entire library's contents memorized with perfect recall, instantly knowing exactly where everything is located.

We achieved this by using three key innovations: First, we eliminated the middleman between the program and the data (like having direct access to the shelves instead of going through a librarian). Second, we use mathematical formulas to calculate exactly where each piece of information is stored without searching. Third, multiple people can read simultaneously without waiting in line.

The result? maph retrieves information in less than 100 billionths of a second—about 100,000 times faster than a blink of an eye. This speed enables new possibilities in financial trading, artificial intelligence, and real-time applications where every microsecond counts.
