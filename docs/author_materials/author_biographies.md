## Extended Bio (200 words) - Journal/Magazine Submissions

Alexander Towell is a PhD candidate in Computer Science at Southern Illinois University, participating in the SIUE/SIUC cooperative doctoral program. His unique career trajectory—transitioning from professional carpentry to computer science at age 30—brings a distinctive perspective to systems research, where craftsmanship and precision remain paramount. This practical foundation informs his approach to building robust, efficient computational systems.

Towell holds MS degrees in Computer Science and Mathematics/Statistics from SIUE, combining theoretical rigor with systems engineering expertise. His research focuses on high-performance computing, particularly in achieving sub-microsecond latency for data-intensive applications. He explores the intersection of compression theory, sequence prediction, and intelligence, drawing inspiration from Marcus Hutter's work on universal artificial intelligence and the compression-prediction equivalence.

His current work on memory-mapped data structures and perfect hashing demonstrates how careful attention to hardware-software interaction can yield order-of-magnitude performance improvements. Through projects like maph, he aims to democratize access to ultra-low-latency data systems, making microsecond-scale performance achievable for broader applications including financial systems, machine learning inference, and real-time analytics.

When not optimizing systems, Towell maintains an active lifestyle through distance running, finding parallels between endurance athletics and the persistence required in systems research. Contact: atowell@siue.edu, lex@metafunctor.com

## Personal/Blog Bio (150 words) - Social Media/Personal Website

After a decade crafting with wood and steel, Alexander Towell discovered his true calling in the abstract constructions of computer science. Making this transition at 30, he brought a craftsman's attention to detail and appreciation for elegant solutions to the world of high-performance computing.

Now a PhD student at Southern Illinois University, Alexander focuses on building systems that operate at the edge of what's physically possible—achieving nanosecond-scale operations through careful hardware-software co-design. His journey from carpentry to computer science, while managing significant health challenges over the past five years, has reinforced his belief that meaningful work transcends circumstances.

His research explores fundamental questions about computation, compression, and intelligence, while his engineering creates practical tools that push the boundaries of performance. The maph project exemplifies this dual nature—theoretically grounded yet immediately useful. Through running and research, he's learned that breakthrough performance comes not from raw speed alone, but from sustained, thoughtful effort toward well-defined goals.
