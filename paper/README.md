# Perfect hash filter: a practical implementation of the Bernoulli set

RDF is a data type that models the concept of the rate-distorted set, which
is a kind of random approximate set.

If the perfect hash function has no rate distortion, then the RDF is a positive
random approximate set. Otherwise, it is a random approximate set.
