An expression for any Boolean algebra may be found in terms of an
expressively-complete set of connectivese, e.g., {NOT, AND},
{NOT, OR}, and {NAND} are each expressively complete.

A popular redundant expressively complete set is {NOT, AND, OR}.
Two particularly common canonical sets of expressions over this
set are the conjunctive normal form (CNF) and disjunctive normal
form (DNF).

A minimal expression over a set of connectives depends on the connectives
given. The count might be of instances of a variable or of connectives.
There might be a bound to the depth or breadth of the expression (perhaps).
